# HI, I'm Ioshua German Castillejos 
## I’m interested in 
  - Using Data Analysis to improve the application behavior, and improve performance.
  - Interpreting data with the creation of great data visualizations that communicate insights.
    I´m skilled using Tableau and Power BI.
# Project 1:

Python - For this project I created a dashboard to visualize the sales for the financial year 2023 from a store.The project involved retrieving data from the client web application, whitout accessing directly to the database.In order to achieve this I followed the below steps:

## Step 1: [Extract Data from a PDF](https://github.com/IoshuaCastillejos/IoshuaCastillejos/blob/main/DataFromPDF)
  -  The initial data was provided in a PDF report and I developed a Python script to extract, transform and clean the data.

## Step 2: [Python Script ](https://github.com/IoshuaCastillejos/IoshuaCastillejos/blob/main/PyDataWebPage)
  -  Once the data was extracted we need more data from the users and the sales note but without accessing the Database the only way it was using the Webapp from the client.
  -  I developed a Python script to automate the task of extracting data from web app.
  -  Cleaning and preparing the data.
## Step 3: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Rabe2023/Dashboard3?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
  - Generating visualizations to represent the data. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

# Project 2:

PowerBI - A Power BI map was created to highlight domestic violence in Mexico City. The map shows that Iztapalapa has the highest rate of domestic violence in the city. [Open Data Portal](https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/victimas-en-carpetas-de-investigacion-fgj)

# Project 3: 
Tableau - Create a map of Conviniences stores called OXXO in the City of Cancun using the data from the [National Statistical Directory of Economic Units (DENUE)](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/mapa/denue/default.aspx).

# Project 4: [Excel to CSV](https://github.com/IoshuaCastillejos/Projects/blob/main/ExceltoCSV.py)
Excel to CSV Processing with Python 2.7- 
The Challenge:
* Process multiple Excel files with varying sheet structures
* Consolidate data by type while maintaining data integrity
* Work within Python 2.7 constraints (no f-strings, limited encoding options)
* Create a reusable, well-documented solution
